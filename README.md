# Song-Lyrics-NLP-
Emotion classification of a song is a common problem with several applications solved by analyzing boath aoudio and lyrics. 
We will intreduce two different types of models that predict the emotion that comes from a song's lyrics.

# Repo intro
Valence prediction from lyrics- building a classifier that predicts whether a song is positive or negative.


## Classic model:


## Neural Network model:
Neural Network for lyrics mood Binary- Classification in Keras.
The approach is to use a Neural Network which uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings, bidirectional-LSTM layer to classify whether the song is happy or sad.
